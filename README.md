The project was extended to now include a mouse base class, that inherits and establishes clone functions like Sheep does.
In order to build, just clone and pull this repo, compile, and run the testCloning.java file. 
The JavaDoc is available under the javadoc folder, with the package-summary.html file being the main head of the doc.
Thanks for teaching this class!
